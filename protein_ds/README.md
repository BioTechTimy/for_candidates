This is test of the practical data science skills of the candidate. Of critical importance is how they think and interact with data.

The problem setup is as follows. We performed a screen of nuclear proteins, tiled into small equal length segments, and screened for activation activity.  There are two conditions, positive selection for activation, and negative selection for no activation.  Feel free to ask questions.

Have fun.
